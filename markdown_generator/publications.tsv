2023-02-01	Evolution of dark matter haloes in CIELO simulations   	BAAA64	This article analyze the dark matter (dm) halo evolution through time. For this study we use a Milky Way like haloes subsample from CIELO (ChemodynamIcal propertiEs of gaLaxies and the cOsmic web) project. This project aims at studying the formation of galaxies in different environments using zoom-ins simulations.	Cataldi, et. al.

2023-05-01	Redshift evolution of the dark matter haloes shapes	MNRAS	In this work, we aim at investigating the morphology evolution of Milky Way mass-like dark matter haloes selected from the CIELO and IllustrisTNG Projects. The connection between halo shapes and their environment has been studied in previous works at z=0 but their connection remains yet to be fully understood. We focus on the evolution across cosmic time of the halo shapes and the relation with the infalling material, using hydrodynamical simulations	Cataldi, et. al.

2022-10-01	Fingerprints of modified gravity on galaxies in voids	MNRAS	In this work, we search for detectable signatures of f(R) gravity and its chameleon screening mechanism in the baryonic and dark matter properties of simulated void galaxies. The enhancement of the gravitational acceleration can have a meaningful impact on the scaling relations as well as on the halo morphology. The galaxy rotational velocity field (calculated with the velocity of the gas disc and the acceleration fields) deviates from the typical values of the Tully-Fisher Relation (TFR) in GR	Cataldi, et. al.

2020-12-01	Baryons shaping dark matter haloes  	MNRAS	In this work we aim at investigating the effects of baryons on the dark matter haloes structure, focusing on the correlation between the presence and importance of stellar discs and the halo shapes. We study the properties of a subsample of DM haloes from Fenix and eagle cosmological simulations.	Cataldi, et. al.

2019-02-01	Dark matter response to galaxy assembly history 	A&A	In this article, we study the properties of four Milky Way mass dark matter haloes from the Aquarius project during their assembly history, between z = 0âˆ’4.
