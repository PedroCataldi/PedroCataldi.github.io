      "Meeting, 60 Years Of The Sersic Law\"\t2023-12-04\tCórdoba, Argentina\thttps://extragalacticmeeting.conicet.unc.edu.ar/\tIn this work, we aim at investigating the morphology evolution of Milky Way mass-like dark matter haloes  selected from the  CIELO  and IllustrisTNG Projects. The connection between halo shapes and their environment has been studied in previous works at z=0 but their connection remains yet to be fully understood. We focus on the evolution across cosmic time of the halo shapes and the relation with the infalling material, using hydrodynamical simulations. Our findings show that haloes tend to be more triaxial at earlier times as a consequence of stronger accretion in the direction of the filaments. As the haloes evolve towards a dominant isotropic accretion mode and relaxation, their shape at 20 percent of the virial radius becomes more spherical. In agreement with previous results, baryons have an important effect within the inner regions of the haloes, driving them from triaxial to rounder shapes. We also find a correlation between the strength of the quadrupole infalling mode and the degree of ellipticity of the haloes: as the filament strength decreases steadily with redshift, the haloes became more spherical and less elliptical.  \n",

On the other hand, the mass in haloes in 𝑓 (𝑅) gravity is more concentrated than their counterparts in GR. This trend changes when the concentration is calculated with the dynamical density profile, which takes into account the unscreened outer regions of the halo. Stellar discs interact with the overall potential well in the central regions, modifying the morphology of the screening regions and reshaping them. We find a trend for galaxies with a more dominant stellar disc to deviate further from round screening regions. We find that small haloes are less triaxial and more round in 𝑓 (𝑅) than their GR counterparts. The difference between halo morphology becomes smaller in 𝑓 (𝑅) haloes whose inner regions are screened. These results suggest possible observables that could unveil modified gravity effects on galaxies in voids in future cosmological tests of gravity.\n",
