excerpt: 'The Γ growth model, characterised by simple parameters (α=3.0, β=0.5 Gyr⁻¹), successfully reproduces the evolution of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function over 13.5 Gyr, with minor deviations at z > 1.5. This suggests that the GSMF’s evolution follows a physically motivated, few-parameter framework consistent with JWST observations.'

The Γ growth model, characterised by simple parameters (α=3.0, β=0.5 Gyr⁻¹), successfully reproduces the evolution of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function over 13.5 Gyr, with minor deviations at z > 1.5. This suggests that the GSMF’s evolution follows a physically motivated, few-parameter framework consistent with JWST observations.
