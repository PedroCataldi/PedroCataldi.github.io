excerpt: 'JWST has revealed ultra-compact, massive galaxies at z ≳ 6, challenging current models. Using FirstLight simulations, we find a universal wet compaction phase—an expansion–compaction–re-expansion cycle driven by central baryon domination—that naturally explains the observed inverted size–mass relation at Cosmic Dawn.'

JWST has revealed ultra-compact, massive galaxies at z ≳ 6, challenging current models. Using FirstLight simulations, we find a universal wet compaction phase—an expansion–compaction–re-expansion cycle driven by central baryon domination—that naturally explains the observed inverted size–mass relation at Cosmic Dawn.
