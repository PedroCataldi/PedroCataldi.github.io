excerpt: 'This article analyze the dark matter (dm) halo evolution through time. For this study we use a Milky Way like haloes subsample from CIELO (ChemodynamIcal propertiEs of gaLaxies and the cOsmic web) project. This project aims at studying the formation of galaxies in different environments using zoom-ins simulations.'
