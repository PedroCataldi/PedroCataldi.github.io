excerpt: 'In this work, we aim at investigating the morphology evolution of Milky Way mass-like dark matter haloes selected from the CIELO and IllustrisTNG Projects. The connection between halo shapes and their environment has been studied in previous works at z=0 but their connection remains yet to be fully understood. We focus on the evolution across cosmic time of the halo shapes and the relation with the infalling material, using hydrodynamical simulations'
