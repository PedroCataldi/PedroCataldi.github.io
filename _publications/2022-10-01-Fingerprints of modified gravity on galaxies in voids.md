excerpt: 'In this work, we search for detectable signatures of f(R) gravity and its chameleon screening mechanism in the baryonic and dark matter properties of simulated void galaxies. The enhancement of the gravitational acceleration can have a meaningful impact on the scaling relations as well as on the halo morphology. The galaxy rotational velocity field (calculated with the velocity of the gas disc and the acceleration fields) deviates from the typical values of the Tully-Fisher Relation (TFR) in GR'
