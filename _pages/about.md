Astrophysics, cosmology and altenartive gravity models

Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a postdocotral student in Numerical Astrophysics at the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our team GANE is focused on solving challenging problems in cosmology, feedback processes and galaxy formation theory. 

As a scientist, Iâ€™m broadly interested in all aspects of astronomy and cosmology and particularly in galaxy formation and galaxy clustering.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Physics from Buenos Aires University, which I was advised by Dr. Susana Pedrosa and worked on alternative cosmological models, baryonics physics and dark matter halo evolution while implementing a numerical approacha and with financial support by the CONICET Phd fellowship (2017) and  LACEGAL-RISE (2020).

I have recently started a postdoc in order to study the assembly bias and galaxy clustering in numerical simulations and to compare with the upcoming LSST surveys. I am currently a member of the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC).

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly kettlebell and running), social activities, and making plans with friends and family.
