In my talk I will present my partial results in the search for Galaxy Assembly Bias in observational data. We focus on how the alignments between central and satellite galaxies vary according to their morphology and color (known as galactic conformity), using cosmoDC2 galaxy catalogs. These catalogs were designed to generate a data-set similar to future LSST surveys to obtain predictions that can be evaluated in the context of future LSST results.
