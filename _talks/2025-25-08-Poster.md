We extend a background subtraction method to estimate the halo occupation distribution (HOD) using photometric data, optimised for LSST-like surveys. Applied to the cosmoDC2 mock catalogue, our approach accurately recovers the HOD across a wide luminosity and halo mass range. We assess performance via purity, completeness, and the reliability of group identification and halo mass estimation.
