In this work, we aim at investigating the morphology evolution of Milky Way mass-like dark matter haloes selected from the CIELO
and IllustrisTNG Projects. The connection between halo shapes and their environment has been studied in previous works at

z=0. We focus on the evolution across cosmic time of the halo shapes and the relation with the infalling material.
