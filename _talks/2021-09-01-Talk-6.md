We found in this article that for a given stellarmass, 𝑓 (𝑅) gravity tends to produce greater maximum velocities. On the other hand, the mass in haloes in 𝑓 (𝑅) gravity is more concentrated than their counterparts in GR. This trend changes when the concentration is calculated with the dynamical density profile, which takes into account the unscreened outer regions of the halo. Stellar discs interact with the overall potential well in the central regions, modifying the morphology of the screening regions and reshaping them. We find a trend for galaxies with a more dominant stellar disc to deviate further from round screening regions. We find that small haloes are less triaxial and more round in 𝑓 (𝑅) than their GR counterparts. The difference between halo morphology becomes smaller in 𝑓 (𝑅) haloes whose inner regions are screened. These results suggest possible observables that could unveil modified gravity effects on galaxies in voids in future cosmological tests of gravity.
