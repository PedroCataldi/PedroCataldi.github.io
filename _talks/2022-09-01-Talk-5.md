This article analyze the dark matter (dm) halo evolution through time. For this study we use a Milky Way like haloes subsample from CIELO (ChemodynamIcal propertiEs of gaLaxies and the cOsmic web) project. This project aims at studying the formation of galaxies in different environments using zoom-ins simulations. We analyse the relation of the properties of the dm haloes in the inner and outer regions. In particular, we inspect the effects on the halo shapes and the assembly process.
