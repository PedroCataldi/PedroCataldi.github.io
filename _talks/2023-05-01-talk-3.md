We search for detectable signatures of 𝑓 (𝑅) gravity and its chameleon screening mechanism in the baryonic and dark matter
(DM) properties of simulated void galaxies. The enhancement of the gravitational acceleration can have a meaningful impact on
the scaling relations as well as on the halo morphology.
